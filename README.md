# vue-bulma-hotdog

Front end development test + learning vue.js

Created based on challenge mockup from [Dyanmit](https://github.com/Dynamit/front-end-code-day/tree/master/hotdog)


# Notes

When completing this challenge I started off new to Vue.js, mainly with experience in Angular, so I started by creating a default Vue CLI project and reading documentation while testing things as I read them. After a lot of reading/watching tutorials. I first attempted to implement the test with Bootstrap CSS, then after not liking the results I made an attempt at using 'bootstrap-vue' framework that implements Bootstrap components as Vue components. After then not liking those results, and specifically being frustrated by not being able to easily modify the grid system with custom flex-box styles (without breaking the whole layout), I decided to research other CSS frameworks. I eventually got to using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and really liked its simplicity and how easy it was to add modifiers to  existing flex-box styles.
